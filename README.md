# Database Course Report - Bank Management System

**Project Overview:**

This project is a Bank Management System developed for the Database course report of the 2nd year Computer Engineering students. The system aims to serve both clients and employees, including managers, by storing and managing data related to clients, employees, accounts, balances, transactions, loans, investments, issues, and more.

## Purpose:

The main purpose of the project is to build a comprehensive system that allows for efficient management of banking operations. This includes storing and retrieving data about clients and employees, managing account information, handling transactions, addressing client and employee issues, and facilitating loan and investment processes.

## Data Model:

### Domain:

The database consists of several tables, each representing different entities within the banking system.

### Relations:

The primary relations and their corresponding column counts are as follows:

- Accounts (4 columns)
- Balance Table (2 columns)
- Clients Table (17 columns)
- Employees Table (17 columns)
- Issues (3 columns)
- Managers (2 columns)
- Transaction Table (5 columns)
- Loan Types (3 columns)
- Loans (6 columns)
- Investment Types (3 columns)
- Investments (6 columns)
- Relatives Accounts (6 columns)

## Logical and Physical Modeling:

The logical and physical modeling of the database includes the creation of tables and defining their attributes and relationships. Additionally, a modeling diagram is available in the provided PDF document.

## Database Implementation:

The database schema is implemented using SQL statements to create tables, define constraints, and establish relationships among different entities.

## Application Implementation:

The application provides functionalities tailored for clients, employees, and managers. Clients can view their balance, perform transactions, update their profile, manage issues, and more. Employees have additional capabilities such as managing client data and addressing client issues. Managers have the highest level of access, allowing them to perform all employee functions as well as managing employees and clients.

## Queries:

Several queries are utilized within the system to perform operations such as checking user roles, retrieving client data, updating balances, inserting transaction records, and more.
